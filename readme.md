This repo holds the Hugo/Terraform configuration and content that creates my personal website, along with a deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Tools used:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for generating the site content
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io) for provisioning the buckets used to host the site
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as the CICD choice
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 as a static site
