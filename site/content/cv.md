I'm a dedicated and driven engineer with 4+ years of industry knowledge, currently working in an DevOps role for Cloudreach's managed services team. Extremely motivated and always hungry to learn.

Practical experience in writing, maintaining and optimizing mission-critical tools hosted across multiple CSPs.

I'm extremely interested in joining a team that builds and manages internal tooling and services. I draw a huge amount of enjoyment of abstracting and automating work for other engineers.

On a more personal level, I'm an avid gamer, wannabe chef and fantasy book reader.
